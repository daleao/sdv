﻿# PROFESSIONS Changelog

## 1.2.0

### Added

* Added compatibility for SVE Premium Barn and Coop.

### Changed

* Reworked Cavewarden:
  * Removed: Increased chance to find treasure and safe rooms.
  * Changed: Chance to resurface unclaimed mining debris is now dynamic, starting at ~10% and increasing with each mine level until ~100% at Skull Caverns floor 200, instead of a constant 50%.
  * Added: Once per day, revive at the last safe room.
* Reworked Demolitionist:
  * Manual bomb detonation is now a much more usable toggle (double tap Mod key), instead of requiring the Mod key be held.
* Reworked Slimed Piper:
  * Changed: Slimes are no longer tamed automatically. Slime taming is now an active ability (double press and hold the Mod key) and has a chance to fail. Success depends on the number of raised Slimes and failure causes the Slime to become enraged.
  * Added: The Slimed debuff now grants a healing over time. The Slime Charmer ring has also been reworked to prevent Slime damage but not the debuff.
* Reworked Slime Conductor:
  * Added: The Slimed debuff additionally grants unlimited use of special move.
* Tamed Slimes will no longer simply disappear when you leave a combat area. Instead, they will warp with you, and then burst after a few second, releasing the contents of their inventory. 
* Tapper recipe cost reduction increased to 50%.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where Angler's second tackle memory was incorrectly set to a Leek.
* Fixed an issue where Angler's first tackle memory was consumed once while recording the second tackle memory.
* Fixed an issue where Angler's tackle memory would not be consumed if no tackle were equipped.

## 1.1.0

### Changed

* Changed the item ID of Ostrich and Golden Mayo, preemptibely resolving the same issues encountered in [Harmonics](../Harmonics/CHANGELOG.md#changed-2).
* AnimalDerivedGoods and ArtisanMachines are now provided as dictionary content assets instead of config settings. Mod authors can now target these dictionaries with Content Patcher to add compatibility for their own mods, instead of relying on users needing to do this manually. Savvy users can still do it manually by adding qualified IDs to the corresponding files within the `assets/data/` folder.

### Fixed

* Fixed a possible conflict with [Ponds](../Ponds).

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 1.0.1

### Added

* Legendary Fish Ponds no longer receive the Aquarist max. population buff. However, the prestiged version of Aquarist now lifts the halved population limit of legendary Fish Ponds.
    * **Regular Aquarist** -> Legendary population cap = 5 (down from 6).
    * **Prestiged Aquarist** -> Legendary population cap = 10 (up from 7).
* Added some clarification to the mod description to clarify that **legendary fish cannot be raised in Fish Ponds without the Aquarist profession**, despite this feature being added in game version 1.6.

### Changed

* Prestiged Spelunker item recovery chance increased from 20% to 50%.

### Fixed

* Fixed a small display issue in the Skill Page menu which caused all level 10 professions to show as "Desperado".

## 0.4.0

Updated for DaLionheart 1.3.0.

### Changed

* Default tracking arrow size was reduced to x1 (default vanilla size), down from x1.2.

### Removed

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.5

* Players can no longer enter the Mastery Cave if one ore more vanilla skills are not at level 10 or above.

## 0.3.4

### Fixed

* I fixed something. I forgot what it was.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.3

### Fixed

* Fixed possible issue in LevelUpMenu code.
* Added missing translation keys. Updated Chinese translation, thanks to Awassakura.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

* Add/remove Mastery commands now also correctly changes Mastery level.
    * You can either use `prfs set <skill> <mastered/unmastered>` to add or remove a mastery, **OR** you can use `prfs add mastery <skill>` / `prfs remove mastery <skill>`. Both commands do the same thing, except that `add` and `remove` commands can accept the parameter `all` instead of a skill name to process all 5 skills at once. Obviously do not use `<>` when actually running these commands.

<sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#professions-changelog)</sup></sup>

## 0.3.1

### Added

* All shaken fruits are now considered forage for the purpose of Ecologist perks.

### Changed

* Angler bonus increased from 0.5% to 1% per unique max-size fish, and from 2% to 5% per Legendary fish.
* Can no longer enter the Mastery Cave unless all skills are level 10 (vanilla behavior). Otherwise this would allow players to claim Mastery of skills at any level, unless I messed around with vanilla code even more, which just isn't worth it.
* Skill Reset stars will no longer appear until the player has 2 or more professions in any skill. This is to avoid players getting stuck looking at bronze stars if they don't plan on resetting any time soon.

### Fixed

* Trash fished out of Fish Ponds no longer counts towards Conservationist perks.

### Changed

* Prestige levels no longer require having all professions in the skill. It is now a reward for Mastering each individual skill. The Statue of Prestige has been renamed to Statue of Transcendence to avoid confusion. 
* Skill reset feature is unchanged. But note that choosing to Master a skill will prevent it from being reset further, effectively locking you out of any unobtained profession. *This may change in the future, but for now you have been warned.*
* Similarly, the Limit Break is now a reward for Mastering the Combat skill.
* All prestiged profession variants, and a few base variants, have been reworked. Prestige professions are now much more impactful end-game rewards. Please review the section [Professions](README.md#professions) of the README to learn more.
* Treasure Hunts are now triggered on Time Change instead of Player Warped. The chance to start a Treasure Hunt now depends on how far you have traveled or how many rocks you have broken since the previous hunt.
* Misc. code improvements.

### Removed

* Removed custom support for Luck skill and Love of Cooking.
* Removed alost all third-party mod integrations since I don't know which of them were/will be updated. I might re-add Automate integration later, or I might not.
