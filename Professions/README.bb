[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]What this is[/font][/size]

This mod is an extensive overhaul of the skill progression and profession tree systems. It replaces the unbalanced and rather [i]boring[/i] vanilla professions with more unique and impactful choices. The goal is not to re-optimize gold-making potential, but to expand the gameplay and encourage new experiences.

Optionally, this mod also brings "classic" game progression tropes, like [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass]Prestige Classes[/url], [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassChangeLevelReset]Class Change Level Reset[/url], and [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak]Limit Breaks[/url]. They are enabled by default, but can be disabled. Learn more about them below.

This mod is inspired by such legendary overhaul mods as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191]Enai Siaion's[/url] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137]Ordinator[/url] for Skyrim and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/users/54536917]ReaperAnon's[/url] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3522]W3EE[/url]. It borrows many ideas and a few assets from the classic [url=https://ro.gnjoy.com/index.asp]Ragnarok Online[/url] and a few other popular games. It also includes new and improved profession icons delivered by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/38784845]IllogicalMoodSwing[/url] ([b]please visit and endorse [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163]Profession Icons Redone[/url][/b]).


[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]The Professions[/font][/size]

Click twice on the professions below to expand for more details. I encourage reading this section fully, as some professions have some "hidden" minor perks not mentioned in their description, while other descriptions are intentionally vague due to the in-game length limitation. Golden text refers to [b]Prestige Professions[/b] (read more about them in the next section). All perks are cumulative except when written [s]with strikethrough[/s], which means a previous perk is being replaced/upgraded.

Level 5 professions always grant one minor early-game perk. Level 10 professions always give two perks: one minor and one major; the minor perk usually being a simple numeric buff, and the major perk a new gameplay feature. These professions have gone through several years of iteration, aiming to strike the right mix of consistency, gameplay fairness, realism/immersion, and overall fun factor.

[*][img]https://i.imgur.com/tMK83Vu.png[/img] [b]Harvester (Lv5)[/b] - 10% chance for extra yield from harvested crops.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/bzpC7KG.png[/img] [b]Master Harvester (Lv15)[/b] - [s]10%[/s] → 20% chance for extra yield from harvested crops.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Equivalent in value to vanilla's 10% price bonus on average, while also providing value should you choose not to sell raw crops.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/JAhCe85.png[/img] [b]Agriculturist (Lv10)[/b] - Crops grow 10% faster, plus 5% per different crop type grown in the same tile and season. Highest-quality crops can be harvested organically, without fertilizers.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/YXpr4ZY.png[/img] [b]Cropwhisperer (Lv20)[/b] - Chance to harvest crops grown previously in the same tile and season. Use Retaining Soil to grow crops out of season.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Every tilled tile keeps a memory of the previous crops grown on that tile in the current season. For each unique crop in that memory, the [i]next[/i] crop gains 5% bonus to growth speed. If prestiged, each crop in memory also has a chance to be harvested as a bonus yield. Chance is 20% for the most recent crop, and decreases by 2x for each subsequent crop (10% / 5% / 2.5% / etc.).

Soil memory resets on the 1st of every season, and is completely lost if the hoe dirt disappears (whether from using a Pickaxe or left unplanted).

[b]Highest-quality[/b] refers to iridium, which normally requires Deluxe Fertilizer. This does [b]not[/b] affect the [i]chance[/i] to obtain iridium quality in any way; it is always equal to half the chance of obtaining gold quality. Fertilizers are still very useful.
Note that quality is determined only on the moment of harvest; planted crops have no quality, which means that this perk will apply to crops planted before obtaining this profession.

When prestiged, Retaining Soil can be used to either extend a crop's lifespan into the next season, or even to grow a whole crop out of season. Each quality of Retaining Soil allows a single tile to sustain an out-of-season crop for a limited number of days:
- [b]Basic Retaining Soil:[/b] 3 days
- [b]Quality Retaining Soil:[/b] 7 days
- [b]Deluxe Retaining Soil:[/b] 13 days

Any crop that fully grows within that time can be harvested as normal despite being out of season.
Retaining Soil can be used to extend a crop's lifetme into the winter season, but [b]cannot be used to plant crops during winter[/b].
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/U7pkTnJ.png[/img] [b]Artisan (Lv10)[/b] - Artisan machines work 10% faster. Machine output quality can be as good as input ingredient quality.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/mb1smYT.png[/img] [b]Industrialist (Lv20)[/b] - Hopper-automated machines work 25% faster. Machine output quality is always as good as input ingredient quality.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
The quality of the output is based on your Farming level. The lowest possible quality is 2 stages below the input quality, and the highest is 1 stage above at a flat 5% chance. For reference, the chance to [i]match[/i] input quality at Farming level 10 is 30%. Note that the quality preservation part of the perk is tied to the Artisan player, while the production time and quality promotion perks are tied to the machine itself; i.e., only Artisans themselves can preserve the ingredient quality, and they can do so on any machine, but non-Artisan players can still benefit from faster production and small chance for quality upgrade (in that case, capped at silver), so long as they use a machine that was crafted by an Artisan player (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs).

In order to maintain the consistency of this profession, this mod also adds two additional optional changes: first, it makes Large Eggs and Large Milk yield double amounts of regular-quality Mayo and Cheese respectively, instead of increasing each to gold-quality, and second, it adds Ostrich and Golden Mayo items, replacing the weird vanilla rules that normally apply to Ostrich and Golden eggs. Blue Mayo is not included. Both options are enabled by default.

[b]Vanilla Hopper behavior is improved by the core mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/24332]Lionheart[/url].[/b]
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/pzj62pg.png[/img] [b]Rancher (Lv5)[/b] - Befriend animals 2x more quickly.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/Ipu2yYK.png[/img] [b]Master Rancher (Lv15)[/b] - Befriend animals [s]2×[/s] → 3x more quickly.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Applies to both mood [i]and[/i] friendship points from petting. Newborn animals are born with a non-zero, randomized initial friendship betwen 150 and 250 (around 1 heart).
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/410Ljxw.png[/img] [b]Breeder (Lv10)[/b] - Incubation 2x faster and natural pregnancy 3x more likely. Increase value of animals at high friendship.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/dG0aSUn.png[/img] [b]Progenitor (Lv20)[/b] - Hatched or bred animals are always worth maximum value. Deluxe Barn capacity +2.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
At max friendship animals are worth 10x their base price, compared to vanilla's 1.3x without this profession. This rather aggressive increase is necessary to achieve reasonable balance with Agriculturist / Artisan. Prestige eliminates the friendship requirement.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/dv1ujZt.png[/img] [b]Producer (Lv10)[/b] - Happy animals produce 2x as frequently. Produce is worth 5% more for every full barn or coop.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/riCLlNf.png[/img] [b]Yieldmeister (Lv20)[/b] - Happy animals produce [s]2x[/s] → 3x as frequently. Deluxe Coop capacity +2.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Note that happiness, or [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Animals#Mood]mood[/url], is [b]not[/b] the same as friendship. This will [b]not[/b] allow certain animals that already produce every day (i.e., cows and chickens) to produce more that once per day.

The bonus produce value also applies to artisan goods derived from animal products (such as cheeses, mayos and cloth), honey (bees can be animals too, via settings), and meats.

Only deluxe buildings can be considered full, and only barns and coops owned by the Producer will be considered (ownership requirements can be turned off in the configs). SVE Premium buildings will also be considered. But they, too, must be [b]full[/b] (i.e., must have 16 animals). If prestiged, [b]this also includes the bonus 2 animal slots[/b], which means that the bonus from coops [i]will[/i] be temporarily lost until those extra slots are filled.

There is no upper limit to the price bonus.

[*][img]https://i.imgur.com/2FmTjJF.png[/img] [b]Forager (Lv5)[/b] - 20% chance for double yield of foraged items.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/akUNM3E.png[/img] [b]Master Forager (Lv15)[/b] - [s]20%[/s] → 40% chance for double yield of foraged items.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Other than the name, changed for consistency with other skills, this profession is unchanged from vanilla.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/6g9IRVA.png[/img] [b]Ecologist (Lv10)[/b] - Foraged items restore 50% more health and energy. The quality of foraged items increases as new varieties are uncovered.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/gEUl2fl.png[/img] [b]Bioharmonist (Lv20)[/b] - Foraged items restore [s]50%[/s] → 100% more health and energy and also afford buffs.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
All foraged items will have the same deterministic quality, providing immediate inventory convenience. However, that quality will initially start out at silver, and gradually progress to iridium as you gather and "study" new varieties of forage.

By default, you must have collected 30 forage varieties to reach max-quality, which is balanced for vanilla. This can be increased in case you have many mods adding new forage items. Only items foraged [i]after[/i] obtaining the profession will be counted.

If prestiged, a buff will be chosen at random the first time a forage is consumed (eaten) since obtaining the prestige. That particular forage will henceforth always afford the same buff [i]for that player[/i], which will be indicated in the item's tooltip. If a different player in the multiplayer session also picks this prestige, their buffs will be different.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/mMWXwRd.png[/img] [b]Scavenger (Lv10)[/b] - Location of forageable items revealed. Occasionally detect buried treasures.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/Na7x4w0.png[/img] [b]Relicseeker (Lv20)[/b] - Time freezes during Scavenger Hunts. Find increasingly more forageables during a high Scavenger streak.[/color][/list][list]
[size=2][spoiler]
Whenever you are outside there is a chance to trigger a [b]Scavenger Hunt[/b] mini-game, which works as a game of "hot-and-cold":
[list]
[*]You must hoe the tiles around you and follow the cues until you find the treasure-containing tile before the time limit. Hoed tiles will point you in the right direction.
[*] If you are far away from the treasure tile, a purple tracking arrow will also be displayed at the edge of the screen, pointing towards the general treasure vicinity.
[*] Rewards include smelted metal bars, artifacts, rare seeds and special equipment.
[*] If prestiged, building up a win streak will cause increased spawns of forage in every outdoors map. This uses your longest win streak instead of your current streak.
[/list]
You can also hold the mod key (LeftShift by default) to highlight all forageable items currently on-screen for easier viewing.
There is a config option to prevent the tracking HUD arrows from being active all the time, and instead display only when holding that same mod key.

If prestiged, building up a win streak will cause increased spawns of forage in every outdoors map. This uses your longest win streak instead of your current streak.

[b]Pointer colors: [/b][color=yellow]Yellow:[/color] Spawned forage items, blooming berry bushes, ginger, coconuts. [color=green]Green:[/color] Artifact spots. [color=purple]Purple:[/color] Buried treasure (Scavenger Hunt only)
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/A1SXkFC.png[/img] [b]Lumberjack (Lv5)[/b] - Felled trees yield 25% more wood.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/jkQMCaj.png[/img] [b]Master Lumberjack (Lv15)[/b] - Felled trees yield [s]25%[/s] → 50% more wood.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
The perk is unchanged from vanilla, but it is now attached to the "correct" profession name.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/l7BxjnL.png[/img] [b]Arborist (Lv10)[/b] - Planted trees grow 25% faster. All trees have a chance to drop hardwood.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/zdJDcEP.png[/img] [b]Silviculturist (Lv20)[/b] - All trees can drop even more hardwood. The Green Rain may fall in any season if Green Rain Trees are grown on the farm.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Applies to both common trees and fruit trees. Note that common trees grow randomly, and so gain 25% bonus chance to advance a stage each night. But fruit tree grow on a fixed schedule, so the perk simply causes every 4th day to be skipped, so as to preserve that predictable growth.

If prestiged, as long as at least one Green Rain Tree grows on the farm, there is a 10% base chance to convert any rainy weather, even those caused by Rain Totems, into Green Rain, plus 2% for each fully-grown Green Rain Tree, up to a maximum of 50%. A "hidden" bonus, also grants 1% additional chance to trigger an overnight [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Random_Events#The_Crop_Fairy]Crop Fairy[/url]﻿ event (should pair well with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/36332]Junimo Hut Fairies[/url]﻿).
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/XTv8SX1.png[/img] [b]Tapper (Lv10)[/b] - Tappers are cheaper to craft. Tapped trees produce syrup 25% faster.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/alCwQz0.png[/img] [b]Syrupwright (Lv20)[/b] - Tapped trees produce syrup [s]25%[/s] → 50% faster. Double yield from recipes that consume syrups.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
New regular recipe: x25 wood, x1 copper bar.
New Heavy recipe: x18 hardwood, x1 radioactive bar.

In order to avoid redundancy with Heavy Tappers and maintain balance, this mod optionally changes Heavy Tapper to produce at the same speed as regular Tapper, but instead double the yield, which brings it more in line with the new Heavy Furnace (enabled by default).
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][/list]
[size=5][img]https://i.imgur.com/TidtIw0.png[/img] [font=bebas_neuebook]Mining[/font][/size]

[list]
[*][img]https://i.imgur.com/YOHojV1.png[/img] [b]Miner (Lv5)[/b] - +1 ore per ore vein.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/7KgdhZR.png[/img] [b]Master Miner (Lv15)[/b] - [s]+1[/s] → +2 ore per ore vein.[/color][size=2]

This profession is completely unchanged from vanilla.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/BUfV7PA.png[/img] [b]Spelunker (Lv10)[/b] - Chance to find ladders and shafts increases as you mine deeper without resurfacing. Restore some health and energy when you reach a safe room.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/japqXDF.png[/img] [b]Cavewarden (Lv20)[/b] - Chance to resurface unclaimed mining debris, higher at deeper levels. Once per day, return to the nearest safe room when you pass out in the Mines.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Adds 0.5% ladder chance per consecutive mine level, which resets when taking the stairs back to the surface.

If prestiged, any items left behind while mining have a chance to spawn back at the Mines or Skull Caverns entrance. The chance increases to near 100% below floor 100 of the Skull Caverns.

For revival, a safe room is equivalent to a treasure room. In the Skull Caverns, the chance to encounter safe rooms is also bumped up a little.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/F54tRpw.png[/img] [b]Prospector (Lv10)[/b] - Location of ladders and mining nodes revealed. Occasionally detect mineral treasures.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/QalCrLN.png[/img] [b]Archaeologist (Lv20)[/b] - Time freezes during Prospector Hunts. Find increasingly more mining nodes during a high Prospector streak.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
This is the mining-equivalent of Scavenger. Tracks all mining nodes, mineral forages, panning spots, mine ladders and shafts.
While mining, there is a chance to trigger a [b]Prospector Hunt[/b] mini-game, which works like a game of "Simon says":[list]
[*]A random nearby stone will begin to glow. Break the glowing stone to reveal the next stone. Continue the sequence until the 7th stone to obtain the treasure.
[*]Each target stone in the sequence becomes progressively harder to break.
[*]Rewards include ores, rare minerals, fossilized artifacts and special equipment.
[/list]
You can also hold the mod key (LeftShift by default) to highlight all ore and gemstone nodes currently on-screen for easier viewing.
There is a config option to prevent the tracking HUD arrows from being active all the time, and instead display only when holding that same mod key.

If prestiged, building up a win streak will cause increased spawns of mining nodes in every mine floor and in the Volcano Dungeon. This uses your longest win streak instead of your current streak.

[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/V8h5E6g.png[/img] [b]Master Blaster (Lv15)[/b] - Exploded rocks yield [s]2x[/s] → 3x as much coal.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Supports the bomberman style of mining, and also alleviates the removal of the vanilla Prospector profession.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/Rmwsynr.png[/img] [b]Demolitionist (Lv10)[/b] - Bomb radius +1. 50% chance to yield additional resources from exploded rocks.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/nFjPIvN.png[/img] [b]Pyrotechnician (Lv20)[/b] - Explosions cause chain reactions. Double the lasting power of coal used for fueling machines.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Further expands the viability of bomberman mining style, and also alleviates the lack of a Geologist profession. An optional buff grants a short burst of movement speed whenever hit by an explosion (can be toggled by the "Get Excited" setting). These perks also apply to Explosive Ammo.

You also gain the ability to manually detonate bombs. Double press the mod key (default LeftShift) to engage manual detonation, and then double press again to trigger the detonation after placing your bombs on the ground.

If prestiged, chain reactions will cause every stone in range of an explosion to itself trigger a small explosion. This allows effective clearing of entire mine levels with a few Cherry Bombs.

"Lasting power" of coal refers to Furnaces and Heavy Furnaces, which will only consume coal every other time.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/P7WHhdQ.png[/img] [b]Gemologist (Lv10)[/b] - Chance for gems to appear in pairs. The quality of mined gemstones increases as new mineral varieties are uncovered.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/EoBMh04.png[/img] [b]Crystallographer (Lv20)[/b] - Chance for gems to appear in triplets. Crystalaria produce perfect replicas.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
The mining-equivalent of Ecologist. All gems and minerals mined from nodes will have the same deterministic quality, starting at silver and gradually increasing to iridium as you collect and "study" new varieties of gemstones. Note that this bonus applies only to gems and minerals that have been physically mined (i.e., crushed geodes do not receive quality).

By default, you must have mined 30 mineral varieties to reach max-quality, which is balanced for vanilla. This can be increased in case you have many mods adding new mineral items. Only counts items mined [i]after[/i] obtaining the profession. Minerals from crushed geodes [i]do[/i] count towards this progression.

If prestiged, a "perfect replica" refers to preserving the quality of the input gem.

[spoiler]
Doubles the chance to attract fish normally associated with every bait, as well as the double catch chance of Wild Bait and the bonus treasure chance of Magnet. Triple when prestiged.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/3X5VNms.png[/img] [b]Angler (Lv10)[/b] - Fish are 1% more valuable for every unique max-sized species caught. Fully-expending a tackle causes it's effects to linger on the fishing rod.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/9DPJjPB.png[/img] [b]Rodmancer (Lv20)[/b] - Up to two tackle effects can linger on the fishing rod. Re-encounter legendary fish on a successful fishing streak.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Legendary fish are worth 5 regular fish (irrespective of size); i.e., 5% bonus to fish sell price. This applies to anything with the `fish_legendary` context tag, which should allow for compatibiltiy with mod-added legendary fish. Unless disabled in the settings, a "MAX" icon will be shown in the Collections menu under each fish which has been caught at max size. A blue icon indicates a regular fish, while a red icon indicates a crab pot fish. Only blue-icon fish are counted for the perk.

By default, the bonus caps at 100%, but this can be configured. Note that [b]not all fih are obtainable at max size[/b], as that depends on the actual size of the body of water where the fish is found. [b]That's okay.[/b] There are plenty of fish to max-out the bonus.

Lingering tackle effects last for 20 uses, which is half as many as a regular tackle.

If prestiged, Legendary fish can be re-encountered, assuming all standard time and weather conditions apply, after 10 successive successful catches. Each subsequent successful catch then increases the encounter rate by 1%, or 2% for a perfect catch. Failing any catch resets the streak back to 0.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/ZwyxtGd.png[/img] [b]Aquarist (Lv10)[/b] - Fish pond max capacity +2. Catching bar decreases slower for every unique fish species raised in a Fish Pond.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/XACHLWL.png[/img] [b]Ichthyologist (Lv20)[/b] - Fish pond max capacity [s]+2[/s] → +4. Fish species raised to max pond capacity are reeled instantly.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Designed for players who struggle with, or just plain dislike the fishing minigame. The catching bar will decrease 5.5% slower per unique Fish Pond, which stacks with Trap Bobber; it should take 12 Fish Ponds + a Trap Bobber to make the bar completely stationary. In multiplayer, only Fish Ponds owned by the player with this profession are counted, though ownership requirements can be toggled off in the settings. Though it isn't stated, this profession also unlocks the ability to raise legendary fish in a pond at reduced max population (5)*. They will not reproduce, but will produce special rare items appropriate to each fish. If you also install the companion mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/24356]Aquarism[/url] you will additionally be able to raise Extended Family in the same pond as their relatives.

If prestiged, an instant catch also automatically catches treasure chests if applicable. This profession removes the lock on max population of legendary ponds, restoring it back to 10. A "hidden" bonus, this profession removes the lock on max population of legendary ponds, restoring it back to 10.

[i]* This profession was designed for a version of the game [b]before[/b] legendary fish were allowed in Fish Ponds. Even though this was added in the 1.6 update, I have decided to [b]not[/b] change the profession. This means that this mod will remove the ability to raise legendary fish, [b]unless[/b] (or until) the player chooses this profession. It is what it is.[/i]

[*][b]Wild bait:[/b] (25 + DailyLuck / 2)% chance to double the stack.
[*][b]Magnet:[/b] Repels all fish (as per its description), but attracts metal items such as resources, artifacts, treasure chests, rings and even some weapons (treasure table is similar to fishing treasure chests).

[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/rHA93zp.png[/img] [b]Oceanographer (Lv20)[/b] - Crab pots without bait can also trap fish. Special conditions apply during rainy or full-moon days.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
By default, every 100 junk items collected nets 1 point of global friendship and a 1% tax deduction the following season. What a "tax deduction" means depends on whether companion mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/24357]Serfdom[/url] is installed; if it is, then a tax deduction works as you would expect: a percent reduction of your overall amount due in [b]income[/b] taxes (property taxes are not deducted). Otherwise, a tax deduction works as a flat % price increase to all items. If you qualify for a deduction you will receive a formal mail from the Ferngill Revenue Service on the first of the season, informing you of your currrent deduction rights.

If prestiged, the fish that can be caught are limited to those ordinarily caught with a crab pot. Your deep knowledge of currents and tidal patterns also allows your crab pots to catch entire schools of fish during days when the weather is rainy or stormy, or during the day of the full-moon (15th). All fish caught during these days receive a dramatic boost to quantity and a +1 boost to quality. On regular days, the chance to catch fish this way is 10%, and regular quantity and quality rules apply.

Completely unchanged from vanilla.

[spoiler]
[b]Rage:[/b] Damage +1% and Attack Speed +0.5% per stack, up to 100 stacks. Rage slowly decays after not dealing or taking damage for 20 seconds, increasing to 40 when prestiged. Wildhearts can expend 10 rage to trigger a special move during cooldown.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/0nODoMq.png[/img] [b]Bushwhacker (Lv10)[/b] - Crit. chance +50%. Chance to poach an item from the enemy with each attack.

[spoiler]
[b]Poaching:[/b] Unless prestiged, each monster can only be poached once. Poach chance is increased by your critical strike chance and luck ([b]not[/b] Daily Luck!), and decreased by the enemy's resistance and jitteriness (yes, that's a real stat which monsters have). Any item from the monster's available loot table can be obtained by this method.

[b]Deadly Poison:[/b] Deals tick damage every second. On second application causes instant-death.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/B6HwzRC.png[/img] [b]Rascal (Lv5)[/b] - Gain one additional ammo slot. 35% chance to recover spent ammo.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/djcciFv.png[/img] [b]Master Rascal (Lv15)[/b] - [s]35%[/s] → 55% chance to recover spent ammo. Can fire both ammo slots at once.[/color][size=2]
[spoiler]
Double press the mod key (default LeftShift) to cycle between equipped ammos. The extra slot can be used to easily switch to and from Explosive Ammo, or Slime; Slime can be equipped as ammo and inflicts a slow debuff to enemies. Only non-squishy and non-explosive ammos can be recovered (i.e., not fish, fruits, veggies, Slime or Explosive Ammo).

If prestiged, holding the mod key while shooting will fire both ammo slots at once. A Monster Musk can be equipped as a pseudo-ammo to the second slot in order to grant to the primary ammo the [b]musked[/b] property.

[b]Musked Ammo:[/b] When a musked projectile collides with a wall or enemy, it transfers the musk to that target, causing other enemies to flock to that spot for 15s. This allows players to completely evade combat. Each slotted Monster Musk lasts for 10 shots. Does not work with Explosive Ammo, but the Monster Musk will still be consumed.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/h7P2nZI.png[/img] [b]Desperado (Lv10)[/b] - Damage +50% from hip-fired shots that hit a new target within 0.8 seconds of the last. Can overcharge the slingshot.

[spoiler]
[b]Hip-firing:[/b] Refers to shots that are released as early as possible (before the overcharge meter appears). When any shot hits an enemy, your next hip-fired shot against a different enemy receives a 50% damage buff if it hits a target within 0.8 seconds. This rewards expert quick-shooting and quickly switching targets, as you would expect of a Desperado.

[b]Overcharge:[/b] Continue holding the fire button past the normal charge threshold to reveal the overcharge meter. Overcharged shots gain up to 2x the original speed, damage and knockback, and can also [b]pierce[/b] enemies.

[b]Piercing Shot:[/b] Piercing chance depends on overcharge percentage and enemy resistance. If successful, a pierced shot then ignores that resistance and can even damage armored enemies. It then pierces the enemy and continues on to damage up to one more enemy behind it. A shot can only pierce once. Only non-squishy and non-explosive ammos can pierce (i.e., not fish, fruits, veggies, Slime or Explosive Ammo).

[b]Rebound Shot:[/b] A prestiged hip-fired shot can bounce off of walls once, allowing you to hit those expert curve shots.
[/spoiler]
[/size][/spoiler][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/XV5jQ3k.png[/img] [b]Slimed Piper | Siren (Lv10)[/b] - Summon raised Slimes to aid you in combat. Designate one Slime to carry items. Slime Hutch capacity +50%.
[spoiler][color=gold][img]https://i.imgur.com/g6pfah7.png[/img] [b]Prismarch | Prismatrice (Lv20)[/b] - Ally Slimes gain unique abilities based on their color. Obtain rare colored items from Slime Balls.[/color][size=2][spoiler]

The most unique out of all new professions. Since we have a profession focused on Fish Ponds, it makes sense to have a combat profession focused on the most underused building in the game: the Slime Hutch. This profession seeks to provide a compelling use for Slime Hutches, both for utility/profit as well as combat effectiveness. Expect some clunkiness with the behavior of Slimes (suggestions and complaints are welcome).

[b]Slime Minions:[/b]
[list]
[*] For every 10 Slimes raised in a Slime Hutch or outside on the Farm, a random Slime will be summoned automatically to aid the Piper in combat. Each full Hutch (at +50% capacity) will spawn 3 Slime minions. There is no cap.
[*] Slime minions are immune to damage from the player, but can be damaged by monsters.
[*] Slime minions can fight other enemies. They can even grab and tank enemy aggro.
[*] Slime minions ignore enemy Slimes, and cannot hit flying enemies other than during a jump attack.
[*] If low on health, you can heal a Slime minion by firing a piece of slime ammo at it from your slingshot.
[*] When a Slime minion is defeated, a new one will be summoned automatically after a 42-second cooldown (1 in-game hour). This does not affect the Slimes in your Farm (they do not disappear when a Slime minion dies).
[*] Slime minions inherit the same stats of the chosen raised Slime, therefore Slimes can be bred to achieve optimal combat stats (see below).
[*] If the profession is prestiged, certain Slime variants will gain unique special abilities: [b]Green:[/b] Causes Slimed debuff. // [b]Blue:[/b] Causes Chilled/Frozen debuff. // [b]Red & Purple:[/b] Causes Burn debuff. // [b]Black:[/b] Causes Blindness debuff. // [b]White:[/b] Grants an aura that heals a low amount of health over time. // [b]Gold:[/b] Causes nearby enemies to drop gold (100g per kill). // [b]Prismatic:[/b] Causes nearby enemies to drop Prismatic Shards.
[/list]
[b]Hat Slime:[/b]
[list]
[*] Interact with any raised or summoned Slime while holding a hat to turn it into a Hat Slime.
[*] As long as it wears a hat, the Hat Slime functions as an item mule; it will follow you around everywhere except indoors, and attempt to collect items dropped on the ground (only dropped items, not forage!).
[*] If a stack of the same item already exists in the player's inventory, the item will be sent to the player automatically. Otherwise, the item will be added to the Slime's own 12-slot inventory.
[*] The Hat Slime's inventory can be checked at any moment by simply interacting with it.
[*] Removing the Slime's hat will dismiss it, turning it back into a wild Slime. Any held items will be dropped on the ground.
[/list]
[b]Slime Breeding:[/b]
[list]
[*] Every Slime is assigned an IV (Individual Value) between 0 and 5 for each of Attack, Defense and Health.
[*] IVs grant a multiplicative bonus to the corresponding stat (x2 at 5).
[*] First-generation Slimes (hatched from eggs) are born with a random IV between 0 and 2.
[*] IVs can be increased by breeding; when a baby Slime is born, it inherits each base stat from the highest between the two parents. IVs are then picked from a normal distribution peaking at 2 points higher than that parent's. This guarantees that IVs will eventually converge to 5 after a few generations.
[*] Baby Slime stats are inherited independently of color; any Slime color can be raised effectively to maximum stats.
[*] Special Gold and Prismatic Slime variants can only be obtained by [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Slime_Hutch#Mating_Color_Results]breeding[/url]: Gold Slime variant can be bred by aiming for RGB(255, 215, 0), also known as [color=#ffc000]HTML Gold[/color]; Prismatic Slime variant can be bred at a low chance when breeding a White Slime RGB(230+, 230+, 230+).
[/list]
[b]Colored Item Drops:[/b]
[list]
[*] If this profession is prestiged, a colored Slime Ball will always drop one random item of the same corresponding color from the game's color-based [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dyeing]Dyeing List[/url]. This requires that the Slime Ball's color be within a 10 chroma-value range of the dye color, which may also require some intelligent [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Slime_Hutch#Mating_Color_Results]breeding[/url].
[/list]
[b]Misc:[/b]
[list]
[*] Increases Slime ammo damage to 20 if not prestiged, and 40 if prestiged.

[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Skill Progression Tropes[/font][/size]

[size=5][font=bebas_neuebook]Profession Change Skill Reset[/font][/size]

If enabled, the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Sewers#Statue%20Of%20Uncertainty]Statue of Uncertainty[/url] is replaced by the [b]Statue of Transcendance[/b].

[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/AoY8YvG.gif[/img][/center]

Instead of changing your profession choices, the Statue of Transcendance will [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassChangeLevelReset]reset[/url] your level 10 skills back to level 0, for a price. Why would you want to do that? Because you get to keep every profession you already have (yes, including level 5), and you can then level up again to acquire a different profession. By doing this enough times, you will eventually have acquired all professions in that skill.

Note that you will inevitably need to choose each 5th-level profession twice on your way to getting both corresponding 10th-level professions. When this happens, [b]you do NOT gain the level 5 perks twice[/b]. These perks are acquired only once, on the first time you choose that profession.

You will also find that leveling becomes progressively easier after each skill reset (or harder, if you choose to configure it that way). By default, resetting a skill will also cause you to forget all associated recipes, but that can also be turned off.

For this incredible service, the Statue will charge you 10,000g the first time, 50,000g the second, and 100,000g the third and last time, although the cost can also be configured. After performing three skill resets, you should have acquired all four level 10 professions simultaneously. As you reset and acquire new professions your progress will be reflected on the skills page menu by a colorful new star, over which you can hover to see the professions you have so far (hovering over the colorful bars will only show the most recent profession you have acquired).

Keep in mind that [b][color=#ffff00]once a skill has been Mastered it can no longer be reset*[/color][/b]. Taking advantage of Skill Reset may be difficult, but will also speed up your experience gain for Mastery and subsequent Prestige levels.

Note also that [b]resetting a skill temporarily prevents the player from receiving Mastery experience or entering the Mastery Cave[/b], until it once again reaches level 10.

All custom mod skills based on SpaceCore are compatible with Skill Reset by default.

[i]* Since so many people did not read the description, [b]nor the in-game warning presented when trying to master an incomplete skill[/b], I have since made it so that, by default, a skill can only be mastered [b]after[/b] performing all resets. This can be disabled in the Mastery settings of the config menu.[/i]

[size=5][font=bebas_neuebook]Prestige Professions[/font][/size]

If enabled, [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mastery_Cave]Mastering[/url] a skill will also unlock it's progression up to level 20, allowing you to continue to develop your tool proficiency, max health and other stats. Some more perks of gaining additional levels include better odds of higher-quality crops, fishes and forage, a larger fishing bar, more berries foraged per bush, and longer-lasting [b]Limit Breaks[/b] (read about them in the next section). More importantly, at levels 15 and 20 you will be offered the choice of a [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass]Prestige Profession[/url].

[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/rIBUmR8.gif[/img][/center]

[b]You may choose only one Prestige Profession per skill[/b] (i.e., you cannot reset to acquire more than one) [b]and can only choose from among those you already have the base version of[/b]; if you only have a single profession because you either did not reset the skill before mastering it, or disabled the Skill Reset feature entirely, then you will automatically receive the prestige of that single profession. If you did reset and acquired multiple base professions, then you will be able to later change your prestige choices back at the Statue of Transcendence, but only after having Mastered all 5 vanilla skills. Changing your prestige choice requires a modest fee of 20,000g (also configurable).

Note that [b]Mastered skills no longer contribute to Mastery experience[/b].

Custom skill mods based on SpaceCore are [b]not[/b] compatible with the Prestige Progression, as they currently cannot be Mastered. This functionality may possibly come to SpaceCore in the future.

[size=5][font=bebas_neuebook]Limit Breaks[/font][/size]

In addition to Prestige Progression, mastery over the Combat skill may optionally unlock a [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak]Limit Break[/url]; a powerful ability that must be charged by performing certain actions during combat. Each combat profession has its own unique Limit Break, from which you will be prompted to choose [b]one[/b] upon claiming your Mastery. You may only choose Limit Breaks from among the professions you have already acquired. In case you are eligible for more than one, you will be able to change your selection, also at the Statue of Transcendance, for free (although a cost can be configured).

During combat you can track the current Limit charge by the HUD bar labeled "L". Once it is full, press [b]and hold[/b] the Mod Key (default LeftShift) to activate it. Alternatively, you may configure a separate Limit Break Key to activate by a simple press.

[list]
[*][img]https://i.imgur.com/K81pOdR.png[/img] [b]Undying Frenzy (Brute / Amazon)[/b] - Unleash your fury for 15s. During this time, you gain double rage accumulation and your health cannot drop below 1. When the effect ends, recover 5% of your max health for every enemy slain during the frenzy.
[size=2][spoiler]
Charged by taking damage or defeating enemies. Charges more quickly if enemies are defeated using a blunt weapon.
[/spoiler][/size][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/WgSlFvA.png[/img] [b]Ambuscade (Bushwhacker)[/b] - Become invisible and untargetable for 30s. Attacking an enemy forfeits the invisibility, but crit. power is doubled for twice the leftover invisibility duration. If an enemy is slain within 0.5s of losing invisibility, immediately reactivates Ambuscade.
[size=2][spoiler]
Charged by scoring critical hits, and the charge amount is proportional to crit. power.
[/spoiler][/size][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/wc6J7DV.png[/img] [b]Death Blossom (Desperado)[/b] - For 15s, enable auto-fire and all shots fire in eight cardinal directions at once at no additional ammo cost.
[size=2][spoiler]
Journey of the Prairie King, "IRL". Charged by hitting monsters with projectiles. Charges more quickly when low on health.
[/spoiler][/size][*][img]https://i.imgur.com/RmS0JSl.png[/img] [b]Hamelin Concerto (Slimed Piper / Siren)[/b] - Place all nearby Slimes under your control for 15s, and empower all Slimes under your control, inflating them up to twice their original size and granting an equivalent power boost.
[size=2][spoiler]
If an enlarged Slime is defeated or the effect ends, it will burst into tiny baby Slimes. Your minion Slimes deflate back to normal. Nearby Big Slimes burst immediately when the effect is activated. Enlarged Slimes can hit flying enemies even when not jumping.

Charged by being touched by Slimes, defeating Slimes and Big Slimes, or shooting Slime ammo.
[/spoiler]

[/size][/list][font=bebas_neuebook][size=6]Misc. Changes[/size][/font]

In case you didn't read every single profession description above, please be aware of the following misc. changes implemented by this mod (all are configurable):
[list]
[*][b]Large dairy goods[/b], including L. Milk and L. Eggs, are changed to double the stack of the processed Mayo or Cheese respectively, instead of increasing the quality to gold. This is implemented to prevent inconsistencies with the Artisan profession (and honestly it just makes sense). Note that this is a straight-up buff, since gold-quality normally only gives a 1.5x price bonus.
[*][b]Golden Mayo and Ostrich Mayo[/b], known in-game as "Shiny Mayonnaise" and "Delight Mayonnaise" respectively, are added to the game where they replace the arbitrary processing rules that are otherwise used for Golden and Ostrich Eggs. This, again, is implemented for the sake of making the Artisan profession more consistent. Credit for these items goes entirely to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ughitsmegan/about-me?gameId=1303]Megan[/url] and Cas ([b]please visit and endorse [/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7660]Ostrich Mayo and Golden Mayo[/url][b]![/b]). Blue Mayo is not included (please don't ask for it; [b]it doesn't make sense[/b]).
[*][b]Slime Mayo and Slime Cheese[/b], are added as well, to add a small amount of depth to the Slime Ranching playstyle enabled by Slimed Piper profession. They are made from regular Slime, and not with Slime Eggs. Credit for these items goes entirely to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Tarniyar?gameId=1303]Tarniyar[/url], author of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6113]Garden Village[/url].
[*][s][b]Fish Smoker[/b] will not preserve fish quality without the Artisan profession. Again, this is needed for the consistency of Artisan.[/s] Removed by popular demand.
[*][b]Heavy Tapper[/b] behavior is changed to be more in-line with the new Heavy Furnace, doubling the output stack instead of halving the production time. This is implemented to avoid redundancy with the Tapper profession.
[*][b]Common Trees[/b] age like [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fruit_Trees#Fruit_Quality_.26_Price]Fruit Trees[/url], which will similarly impact the quality of produced syrups. This is implemented to improve the long-term viability of the Tapper profession (and again, this also just makes sense, making Common Trees more analogous to Fruit Trees).
[/list]
[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook]Compatibility[/font][/size][b]

[size=3]Custom Skill Mods[/size][/b]

Compatible with all custom [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1348]SpaceCore[/url] skills. They can be reset, [b]but cannot be Prestiged[/b]. As far as I know, SpaceCore does not yet support Mastery of custom skills, and until it does there is nothing I can do about it. Note that [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/521]Luck Skill[/url] is not a SpaceCore skill, but [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/28103]Luck Skill[/url] is.

[b][size=3]Automate[/size][/b]

This mod expects that you use Hoppers for automation instead, as they are improved by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/24332]DaLionheart[/url].That said, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063]Automate[/url] should work fine, but certain profession perks may not apply, including Industrialist. You must attach a Hopper to your process chain if you wish to benefit from the Industrialist perk. For any other profession with perks related to a specific machine, Automating that machine will continue to apply those perks as long as the machine does not require input (see FAQ below for more details).

Automate is not officially supported. My stance is that the perks of your professions being lost are the tradeoff for the convenience of Automate. So please do not ask for further integration. If you choose to run Automate, do so with the understanding that it will retract from the intended experience.

[b][size=3]Stardew Valley Expanded[/size][/b]

[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753]Stardew Valley Expanded[/url] will always be fully supported, but I may not be up-to-date with its newest releases. Please report new changes to SVE that you feel should be reflected in this or any of my mods, such as legendary fish that need Aquarist support.

[b][size=3]Other Profession / Skill / Mastery Overhauls[/size][/b]

For any mods that affect professions, skills or Masteries, [b]use common sense[/b]. Mods which add alternative ways to acquire multiple professions, such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/174]All Professions[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/569]Skill Prestige[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23697]Mastery Extended[/url], will obviously conflict with [i]Change Profession Skill Reset[/i], so either remove those mods or disable [i]Skill Reset[/i] in this mod's settings. Likewise, any mod which extends or otherwise changes the level cap or level progression, such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1471]Level Extender[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22920]Level Forever[/url], will obviously conflict with Prestige level progression, and consequently, [i]Prestige Professions[/i]. Either remove those mods or disable [i]Prestige Levels[/i] in this mod's settings. For any other mod or specific combination, do not ask me about it. I do not support integration with any of these types of mods. They are not meant to work together.

The base reworked professions up to level 10 should not conflict with any of the aforementioned mods. So if you don't like this mod's progression tropes you can always disable all of the tropes and use whatever progression mods you want, keeping only the profession changes.

Obviously not compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20054]Vanilla Plus Professions[/url]. Use one or the other. Your save [b]will break[/b] if you try both.
Not compatible with mods that change how the game awards experience, such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22163]Share Experience.[/url]

[b][size=3]Multiplayer[/size][/b]

Yes, it should work in multiplayer.

[b][size=3]Android[/size][/b]

No, it does not work on Android.

[spoiler][b]A new save[/b] is not required, but [b]is strongly recommended[/b].Adding to an existing save will cause you to miss out on the intended experience of progression, especially for very late game saves.If your skills are already all Mastered before installing this mod, you will be unable to use the Skill Reset feature, and don't be alarmed if your skills end up recalculated to levels 11-20.But do keep in mind that, [i]in general[/i], you should avoid adding or removing mods to/from existing saves, as that's a very good way to corrupt a save.Try out new mods for a few mins on a new save first. Then settle on a mod list before you start, and [b]stick with it[/b] for the next save.If still you really want to add this mod to a late-game save and use the Statue of Transcendence at the Sewer, you can use provided console commands to undo your masteries and reset your skill levels back down to 10:
[code]prfs set <skill name> unmastered[/code]
[code]prfs set <skill name> <level>[/code]
[/spoiler]
[b]Do Ecologist and Gemologist professions count forages/gems acquired before the profession?[/b]
[spoiler]No.[/spoiler]
[b]Do Artisan/Producer/Aquarist and similar professions based on ownership of a machine or building, apply retroactively to machines/buildings that have already been crafted/built?[/b]
[spoiler]Yes.[/spoiler]
[b]Can Luremaster and Conservationist work together?[/b]
[spoiler]Of course. Luremaster applies only to crab pots with bait. Conservationist applies only to crab pots without.[/spoiler]
[b]Can I obtain all prestige professions simultaneously?[/b]
[spoiler]No, sorry. Making tough choices is part of this mod's design.You can cheat them in with console commands if you really want (`profs add -p all`).[/spoiler]
[b]Can I obtain all Limit Breaks simultaneously?[/b]
[spoiler]Obviously not.[/spoiler]
[b]I don't like X or Y perk. Can I disable it?[/b]
[spoiler]No. If you dislike a particular perk, make your case in the description page. Tell me what your experience has been, why it was negative, and what you would do differently. My goal is not to make an un-fun mod. So, if something isn't working, I need your feedback to improve it.[/spoiler]
[b]Can I individually pick which professions I want to be modded or remain vanilla?[/b]
[spoiler]No. See previous question. If you just want vanilla Artisan back then I don't think you understand the point of the mod.[/spoiler]
[b]What do Legendary Fish produce in Fish Ponds? How long do they take to multiply?[/b]
[spoiler]They will produce ores, gems and other valuables fitting to the fish's theme, as well as, obviously, roe. Other than Angler when placed together with Ms. Angler, they do not reproduce. You can fill the ponds up with Extended Family fish if [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/24356]Aquarism[/url] is installed.[/spoiler]
[b]The Statue of Transcendence in the Sewer doesn't work! I can't reset my skills![/b]
[spoiler]Scroll back up to the Skill Reset section and make sure you have read the part where it says [quote][b]once a skill has been Mastered it can no longer be reset[/b][/quote][/spoiler]
[b]I didn't read the description and/or chose to ignore the warnings. How can I undo my masteries?[/b]
[spoiler]As with 90% of self-inflicted problems, the answer is [b]console commands[/b].

[b][color=#ffff00]Always check the console commands first.[/color][/b]

You can list them with `prfs help`.

To save you a few seconds, here are the console commands to undo your masteries and reset your skill levels back down to 10:
[code]prfs set <skill name> unmastered[/code]
[code]prfs set <skill name> <level>[/code]
[/spoiler]
[b]Does it work with XYZ mod?[/b]
[spoiler]I have not tested every mod on the Nexus. I have better things to do. If it's not mentioned in the [b]Compatibility[/b] section then you try it yourself and let me know.[/spoiler]
[b]When using the Automate mod, which machines will/won't apply profession perks?[/b]
[spoiler]Machines generally operate on the following 3-stage cycle:
1. It chooses an output (profession perks apply here).
2. It makes you wait for the output.
3. You retrieve the output.

When automated, the Automate mod takes over step 3 on all machines, and also step 1 [b]if and only if[/b] an input item is required. Therefore, as long as a machine does not require any input, then whether or not step 3 is automated is irrelevant. Hence, these machines always apply profession perks. This includes things like Tapper, and also the Crystalarium (after the initial gem).

When input [b]is[/b] required, Automate bypasses the vanilla code which needs to run in step 1 for profession perks to apply. Most machines that do take an input therefore will [b]not[/b] apply profession perks. This includes all Artisan machines. Could they be made compatible? Yes. But my stance is that Artisan perks should not apply to automated products, as that is antithetical to the idea of an Artisan (i.e., one who makes things by hand).

Crab Pots are an exception. Although they may use an input (bait), their production is delayed until a specific moment in time (i.e., new day), instead of being chosen right away. In other words, the Crab Pot (and similar machines that produce [i]per day[/i] instead of [i]after X minutes[/i]) output is not determined in step 1, but actually during step 2. Hence, as Automate never interferes in step 2, that means professions will be applied.[/spoiler]
[b]Automate won't load bait into my Crab Pots since I got the Conservationist profession. What gives?[/b]
[spoiler]This should no longer be an issue since 1.6.9.[/spoiler]
[b]How can I make machines / dairy from different mods compatible with the Artisan / Producer profession?[/b]
[spoiler]Make a copy of one of the example files inside `assets/data` folder, either [b]Example.ArtisanMachines.json[/b] or [b]Example.AnimalDerivedGoods.json[/b], depending on what you want to add. Change the file prefix to whatever you like (I recommend naming it after the particular mod and creating a new file for each mod), [b]but you must keep the format `xyz.ArtisanMachines.json` or `xyz.AnimalDerivedGoods.json`[/b]. Then, add the Qualified Item IDs of the desired items into the corresponding list.

Cornucopia compatibility already ships with the mod, so you can use it as an example as well. Below it is explained how to locate machine IDs in Cornucopia. Note that different mods may organize their internal files differently.
[list]
[*]Open the Cornucopia mod folder. You'll see a folder named "machines". Inside you will see a different file named after each machine.
[*]Open the machine you want, say `butterchurn.json` using any text editor. It will look something like this:
[/list]

[code]{
    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "EditData",
            "Target": "Data/Machines",
            "Entries": {
                "(BC)Cornucopia_ButterChurn": {
               ...

[/code]

[list]
[*]Copy the string starting with "(BC)...". This is the qualified ID of the machine.
    [list]
    [*]A machine's qualified ID will always start with "(BC)".
    [*]An animal produce item's qualified ID will always start with "(O)".
    [/list][*]Open your new asset file at [b]`DaLion.Professions/assets/data/xyz.ArtisanMachines.json`[/b].
[*]Paste the ID of the machine into the list, separated by a comma. The result should look something like this:
[/list]

[code]"ArtisanMachines": [
    "(BC)ExampleMod.ExampleMachine",
    "(BC)Cornucopia_ButterChurn"
  ],
[/code]

Repeat for every machine that you think is relevant. For animal produce, do the same but add to "AnimalDerivedGoods.json" file instead.

As noted above, each mod may organize their files differently, so you may not find a specific file for each machine / item. Some authors may group all machines into a single `machines.json` file for example, and yet others may put everything inside CP's base `content.json` file.
