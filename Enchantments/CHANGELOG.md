## 2.0.0

Updated for game version 1.6.14.

### Added

* Added non-optional Jade Enchantment rebalance. The vanilla version is completely useless at 10% crit. power because it's the same amount given by Ruby Enchantment, but while the Ruby applies to every hit, the Jade only applies to critical hits.
    * Before: crit. power +10%
    * After: crit. power +50%
